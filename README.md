# Water-safety-and-analysis

Analysis of the variables influencing water safety and quality is the goal. To decide whether the water is safe to drink, we train a machine learning model. 

Data on the variables impacting water safety are included in the water potability dataset, which is acquired from Kaggle. 

The analysis clarifies all the elements that influence the potability of the water. The score values indicate the range of water pollution and drinkability. If the water is fit to drink or not. In the near future, a larger variety of data sets will be able to be utilized to forecast whether the water is potable or not for a specific area and under specific conditions.
